# jiggler

Named after the happy, active [the Adventure Time
creature](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jigglers), the Jiggler is a
simple custom shortlinks service intended to basically provide global bookmarks
for a whole company.

Jiggler's docs are self-hosted. Jiggler is easiest to access via a chrome
extension that lets you just type in `j shortlink` in your browser bar. (It can
do the same thing in Firefox or other browsers by acting as a custom search
provider.)

# Moving Parts

Jiggler is a tiny service that runs as an uberjar. Internally, we run it with
an 80MiB Stack. It uses a tiny Postgres database (allocate maybe 10MiB for
it?).

# Chrome extension

The Chrome Extension's (super simple) code is in the `chrome-extension`
subdirectory here.

## Tests

Jiggler is pretty thoroughly tested. Run tests via `lein test`.

## Running Locally

To run with a simple SQLite db:

```
lein run -- --port 8666 --sqlite /tmp/jiggler.db
```

To run with default local PostgreSQL connection:

```
lein run -- --port 8666
```

### Database setup for development

#### Running PostgreSQL via docker

1. Download the postgres container with `docker pull postgres`.
2. Run the server (in the foreground) with
   `docker run --name postgres-jiggler -p 5666:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=jiggler -e POSTGRES_USER=jiggler -e POSTGRES_DB=jiggler postgres`
3. Set up the database with
   `docker exec -i postgres-jiggler psql < resources/sql/001-init.up.sql`
4. Run jiggler with
   `PGPASSWORD=jiggler PGUSER=jiggler lein run -- --port 8010 --database-port 5666`

#### With local Postgres

1. Start PostgreSQL.
2. Create a user (e.g. `jiggler`) with some password.
3. Run `psql [db options] < resources/sql/*.up.sql`.
4. Run `psql [db options] "GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO [jiggler];"`
5. Run jiggler with
   `PGPASSWORD=[your password] PGUSER=[your user] lein run -- --port 8010`
